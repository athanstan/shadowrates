<div>
    {{-- TODO
This is destined to be a small no pagination collection with
modular flags to be able to decide which filter to show, or if we'll have pagination
on the cards or search. etc.

It is destined to be used in the UserProfile page, and will be passed the cards
collection of the user to display.

The idea is for the user to be able to add cards to the collection from any page
that this collection will be added.

and it will always accept a model. Either a User or a Deck.

so that it will show the cards and it will calculate the authenticated user's
collection quantities of these cards.
